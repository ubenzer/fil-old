# Hello World From a Test Post!

A blog engine should support code highlighting which is rendered on
server side. We don't have that feature yet. But it should be added
at some point. So:

```javascript

var x = "test";
function toY(a) {
  return a + " " + x;
}
```

will be rendered as a coloured *JavaScript* code at some point.

## Don't forget about Antalya !
